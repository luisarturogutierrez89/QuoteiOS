#  Brillio - iOS Coding Test

## Description

The aim of this project is to create a straighforward iOS app that fetches data from a remote data 
service and effectively displays the information on the view.

https://api.quotable.io/random (GET request) 

Once the data is fetched, we are only interested in populating these fields on the view:
`content`
`author`

Furthermore, include a refresh button to trigger another call to the remote service.

## Criteria for Completion

[] Project should compile successfully.
[] The app should be able to display a random quote with its author on the view.
[] A refresh button should be visibly displayed on the view.
[] When the refresh button is tapped, it triggers a call to the remote data service.
[] The app should display an activity indicator to indicate a data fetch process.
[] The activity indicator must be placed in the horizontal and vertical centers of the screen.
[] The activity indicator should be removed from the view as soon as the data is displayed.
[] The project must follow the MVVM pattern.
